**UIn Class team Exercise – Business Rules and ER Diagrams**

Use the following descriptions of the operations of RC\_ Models Company to complete this exercise. RC\_ Models Company sells its products— plastic models (aircraft, ships, and cars) and “add- on” decals for those models— through its Internet Web site, www. Rc\_models. com. Models and decals are available in scales that vary from 1/ 144 to 1/ 32\.

Customers use the Web site to select the products and to pay by credit card. If a product is not currently available, it is placed on back order at the customer’s discretion. (Back orders are not charged to a customer until the order is shipped.) When a customer completes a transaction, the invoice is printed and the products listed on the invoice are pulled from inventory for shipment. (The invoice includes a shipping charge.) The printed invoice is enclosed in the shipping container. The customer credit card charges are transmitted to the CC Bank, at which RC\_ Models Company maintains a commercial account. (Note: The CC Bank is not part of the RC\_ Models database.)

RC\_ Models Company tracks customer purchases and periodically sends out promotional materials. Because the management at RC\_ Models Company requires detailed information to conduct its operations, numerous reports are available. Those reports include, but are not limited to, customer purchases by product category and amount, product turnover, and revenues by product and customer. If a product has not recorded a sale within four weeks of being stocked, it is removed from inventory and scrapped.

Many of the customers on the RC\_ Models customer list have bought RC\_ Models products. However, RC\_ Models Company also has purchased a copy of the FineScale Modeler magazine subscription list to use in marketing its products to customers who have not yet bought from RC\_ Models Company. In addition, customer data are recorded when potential customers request product information.

RC\_ Models Company orders its products directly from the manufacturers. For example, the plastic models are ordered from Tamiya, Academy, Revell/ Monogram, and others. Decals are ordered from Aeromaster, Tauro, WaterMark, and others. ( Note: Not all manufacturers in the RC\_ Models Company database have received orders.) All orders are placed via the manufacturers’ Web sites, and the order amounts are automatically handled through RC\_ Models’ commercial bank account with the CC Bank. Orders are automatically placed when product inventory reaches the specified minimum quantity on hand. (The number of product units ordered depends on the minimum order quantity specified for each product.)

1\)	Given that brief and incomplete description of operations for RC\_ Models Company, write entities, attributes and all applicable business rules to establish relationships. Write the Entities/attributes in the format below.  
Customer (Cust\_Id,Cust\_Name ……..)  Do not spend too much time on attributes now.

2\) Write Business Rules for the relationships : Use the following three business rules as examples, writing the business rules for relationships in the same format. Requirements/rules that don’t specific entities, attributes, relationships, constraints  should be written separately.  
a) 	A customer may generate many invoices.  
b)	Each invoice is generated by only one customer.  
c) 	Some customers have not (yet) generated an invoice.

     One customer can have multiple products.  
     One customer can have multiple invoices.

      3\) Document any assumptions you need to make in a section called assumptions   
   
4\) Create a draft ER model in [https://www.drawio.com/](https://www.drawio.com/)  . Dont worry about filling in all attributes. Just entities and relationships. This is a draft, you will work on it

5\) submit one document PDF (business rules)  and one ER model from Draw.io, Individually.

## Additions and Clarifications (prioritized)


To make the RC_Models model more useful for your assignment while keeping it minimal, I kept two focused additions you asked for: ShipmentLine and Payment/CreditCardTransaction. These add the ability to track which invoice/PO lines are shipped and to record payment attempts/status without modeling the external bank.

### ShipmentLine (added)
* shipment_id (PK, FK to Shipment)
* line_no (PK)
* ref_type (invoice|po)
* ref_id (FK to Invoice or PurchaseOrder depending on ref_type)
* ref_line_no (references invoice or po line)
* product_id (FK)
* qty_shipped

Purpose: Tracks which invoice lines or PO lines are fulfilled by each shipment; supports partial shipments and consolidated shipments.

### Payment / CreditCardTransaction (added)
* payment_id (PK)
* invoice_id (FK)
* payment_date
* amount
* payment_method
* status (authorized|captured|refunded|failed)
* auth_code
* last4 (tokenized card info only — do not store full PAN)

Purpose: Record card authorization/capture state for each invoice. The CC Bank is external; store only non-sensitive fields necessary for reconciliation.

## Revised business rules (focused)
- An Invoice contains one or more InvoiceLines; each InvoiceLine may be fulfilled by one or more Shipments (partial shipments allowed). ShipmentLine records qty_shipped against an invoice line or a PO line.
- Payment attempts for an Invoice are recorded in Payment/CreditCardTransaction. Back orders are not charged until the order is shipped; a Payment is created/captured at shipment time.

## Assumptions (focused)
- Shipments are used for outbound shipments to customers; ShipmentLine supports linking to inbound supplier POs if needed (via ref_type).
- We will not store full credit card PANs in the database (store only last4 or token) to stay PCI-aware.
- Returns/Refunds are not modeled here; add Return/Refund entities if needed later.

If you'd like, I can now:
- produce a Draw.io XML for this focused ERD, or
- produce a compact PlantUML diagram you can use to visualize and import.
